\subsection{Assumptions} % Assumptions

To simplify the problem and make it convenient for us to simulate real-life conditions, we make the following basic assumptions, each of which is properly justified.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Assumption 1:} The sea surface of the Ionian Sea remained stable during our study period. \newline
	      \textbf{Justification:} The Ionian Sea is located in the central Mediterranean Sea, bordered by the Adriatic Sea to the north, Calabria and Sicily in Italy to the west, and Albania as well as many Greek islands to the east, making it a vast area. Therefore we assume that the sea area will not change significantly and that there is no risk of the submersible and the host ship running aground.


	\item \textbf{Assumption 2:} Climate types in the Ionian Sea remained constant over the study period.  \newline
	      \textbf{Justification:} The climate type of the Ionian Sea is Mediterranean, influenced by the subtropical high and the westerly wind belt, the salinity of the seawater, the air pressure, and the seawater temperature are roughly stable, so that the size of the wind, the strength of the ocean currents and the density of the seawater are approximately the same.


	\item \textbf{Assumption 3:} The Ionian Sea will not experience large natural disasters during the study period. \newline
	      \textbf{Justification:} Large natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and typhoons can
\end{itemize}
